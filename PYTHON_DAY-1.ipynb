    "\n",
    "2. **`for... in...` loops**: These loops iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. They are ideal for iterating through known sequences or ranges of values, allowing for clear and concise iteration over collections or ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of loops are fundamental for controlling the flow of execution and repeating tasks efficiently in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  1.0. while... loops\n",
    "\n",
    "After introducing conditional structures, we turn our attention to loop structures: these structures allow a block of instructions to be executed multiple times. These repetitions fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional repetitions**: The block of instructions is repeated as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unconditional repetitions**: The block of instructions is repeated a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for defining `while` loop instructions is as follows:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "   while condition:\n",
    "        block_of_instructions\n",
    "        increment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the `if` structure, the condition is first evaluated, and if it is true, the block of instructions is executed. However, with the `while` loop, after executing the block of instructions, the condition is evaluated again. This process repeats until the condition becomes false. Therefore, it is essential to define an increment variable whose value changes after each execution so that the condition can eventually become false. This increment is necessary to prevent the instructions from being evaluated indefinitely, creating an infinite loop (or endless loop). Such a situation requires forcibly stopping the program's execution."
